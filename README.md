# The Golden K Hypothesis: Axiomatic Synthesis, Emergent Dynamics, and Phenomenology

This repository presents the full formulation of the **Golden K Hypothesis**, a unifying theoretical framework that derives the structure of spacetime, matter, and interactions from the Golden Ratio \( \Phi \) and its inverse \( \phi \).

## 🔬 Abstract
The Golden K Hypothesis postulates that the fundamental constants of nature (including \( G, \hbar, c \)) emerge from a harmonic geometry governed by the golden ratio. It replaces the Planck length with a new scale:

\[
l_K = \Phi \cdot 10^{-35} \, \text{m}
\]

All interactions—including gravity and quantum behavior—are unified through this geometry, avoiding fine-tuning and arbitrary parameters.

## 📐 Key Features
- Golden Length \( l_K = \Phi \cdot 10^{-35} \, \text{m} \)
- Golden Mass \( m_K = \frac{\hbar}{c l_K} \)
- Dynamic spacetime emerging from E8 projection
- Fractal field structure with fractional derivatives
- Superposition and emergence of observed constants

## 📊 Status
This is an independent scientific hypothesis aiming to open a new direction in unified physics.
